# bash

Forked version of bash supporting shell interactions (e.g. writing builtins or
modifying variables, arrays, and functions) natively in rust via the scallop crate.

## Development

Note that the development workflow involves rebasing against upstream and force
pushing to keep the patch stack in order.
